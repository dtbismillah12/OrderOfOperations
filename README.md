# OrderOfOperations
Creating Readme

This is a game application designed to help the user learn/practice solving expressions in the correct order. It will essentially teach players about the order of operations within math and computer science.

To play, you simply maneuver your spaceship around and try to shoot asteroids containing the next correct operator. If the player hits the right asteroid, the feedback button in the bottom right turns green and 50 points are added to the score. If the player shoots the wrong asteroid, the feedback button turns red and 50 points are subtracted from the stores. In addition, each UFO the player hits adds 10 points to the score. Every time they player is hit by the UFO bullets or collides with an asteroid, then the player loses a life (there are 3 lives per round). The difficulty of the expression increases as the player passes more rounds.
